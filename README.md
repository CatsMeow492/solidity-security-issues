# solidity-security-issues
This project is meant to be a non-comprehensive collection of example solidity projects highlighting know security issues in blockchain development.  The idea be that seeing how these function in code will help developers avoiding repeating passed mistakes. In the future I'd like to create a full history of how these were discovered with real life examples.
